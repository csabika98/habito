the docker-compose will host a keycloak server. It will import the realms found in the import folder.
The realm also contains roles and users!
If you want to update the realm that is imported, you can export your current realm and take it as a base.
Recommendation is
    1. make your change in Keycloak UI
    2. export the realm
    3. compare exported realm with the one in the import folder
    4. update the realm in the import folder

-- exports a specific realm to a file
cd /opt/keycloak/bin/ && ./kc.sh export --file /tmp/exported-realm.json --realm < realm_name >
